    Request queueing filter, used for load control of specific high load urls. The
    RequestQueueingFilter class can be configured to act as a Denial-Of-Service
    prevention tool, by sharing the responses of requests with identical inputs that enter
    the container concurrently. See the Filter tutorial for more information
    (dm3fw-spring2-blog/docs/utilityfilters.html).
