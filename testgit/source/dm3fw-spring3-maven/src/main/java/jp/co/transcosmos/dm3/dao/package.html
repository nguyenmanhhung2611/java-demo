    <p>Data Access Object(DAO) API related classes - this package contains the interfaces
    required for implementation of the DAO pattern and criteria based searches, as well
    as a Reflection-based sample implementation.</p>
    <p>The majority of the classes in this package are for the purposes of internal 
      implementation, but the following classes are relevant to the application developer:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>CustomReadOnlyDataSupport</b> - for simple custom DAO implementations</li>
      <li><b>DAO, ReadOnlyDAO</b> - the external interface definitions</li>
      <li><b>DAOCriteria, OrCriteria</b> - for building query filters</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Additionally, the following classes are often used from Spring, even though they
      aren't otherwise used directly by the application developer:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>ReflectingDAO</b> - the basic reflection-based default DAO implementation</li>
      <li><b>FilterDAO</b> - a wrapper DAO that applies a fixed filter to all queries on another DAO</li>
      <li><b>JoinDAO</b> - for joining two table DAOs together (like an SQL join view)</li>
      <li><b>StarJoinDAO</b> - for joining multiple other table DAOs together in a star formation</li>
      <li><b>UnionDAO</b> - for appending the results of one searches from one DAO to another's results</li>
    </ul>
