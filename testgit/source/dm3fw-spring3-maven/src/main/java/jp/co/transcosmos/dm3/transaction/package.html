    Request scope datasource implementation, allowing auto-commit or rollback on transactions
    opened at the start of a request when the request is completed. The data source is mounted
    as a wrapper around another plain JDBC datasource object, and the wrapper submitted to 
    Spring's request scope management. When a RequestScopeDataSource is about to go out of 
    scope it is committed or rolled back, based on whether or not an exception was thrown.
